  // above, but Terraform allows us to reference our key pair resource block.
  // This also declares the AWS keypair as a dependency of the aws_instance
  // resource. Terraform builds a graph of all the resources and executes in
  // parallel where possible. If we just hard-coded the name, it is possible
  // Terraform would create the instance first, then create the key, which

// If we run `terraform plan 02-single-instance`, Terraform will tell us it will
// create the single EC2 instance. You will notice some resources are marked as
// "<computed>", and some resources have been calculated. For example, the ami
// and key_name fields have been pre-computed, but there are other fields that
// Terraform does not know yet. For example, Terraform cannot know the IP
// address of the instance before it is created. Some fields are not populated
// until after the resource has been created.

// Once Terraform creates the instance, it does know the value of those fields.
// Run `terraform apply 02-single-instance`. This can take a few minutes. When
// the apply has finished, run `terraform show`. You will see all of the
// attributes Terraform saved during the instance creation including its
// IP addresses, tags, dns information, subnet, and more. You can look in the
// EC2 console and see that an instance was created and that instance is named
// "Tutorial".
